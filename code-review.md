# Tech Portfolio Code Review

## Overview

This is a well-structured front-end developer portfolio site built with:

- Vite as the build tool
- Vanilla JavaScript (no framework)
- SCSS for styling
- Component-based architecture

## Strengths

### Architecture

- **Modular Design**: The project follows a component-based architecture, making it maintainable and scalable.
- **Clear Separation**: Each UI component is its own module with clear responsibilities.
- **Efficient Structure**: The codebase is well-organized with logical directory structure.

### Code Quality

- **Clean JavaScript**: The code follows modern ES6+ practices with proper function exports/imports.
- **SCSS Organization**: The styling is well-structured with variables, nesting, and modular components.
- **Performance Optimization**: CSS animations and transitions are used appropriately without causing performance issues.

### UI/UX Features

- **Interactive Elements**: The site has several engaging interactive features:
  - Dark mode toggle
  - Animated logo
  - Smooth scrolling
  - Carousel for tech stack
  - Snake game easter egg
- **Responsive Design**: The SCSS includes media queries for different screen sizes.
- **Modern Visual Effects**: Uses CSS features like gradients, animations, and transforms effectively.

### Accessibility & Performance

- **Semantic HTML**: Proper use of headings, sections, and HTML5 semantic elements.
- **Color Contrast**: The color scheme variables help maintain consistent contrast.
- **Performance Considerations**: Uses CSS transitions instead of JavaScript where possible.

## Improvement Opportunities

### Code Structure

- **Global Variables**: The `snakeGame` variable in main.js is defined outside any scope, which could lead to conflicts.
- **Duplicated Function Call**: `initPixelAvatar()` is called twice in main.js (lines 203 and 210).

### Build Optimization

- **Font Loading**: Consider using font-display property for the Google Fonts to improve performance.
- **Image Optimization**: Add image optimization to the build process for any images used.

### Feature Enhancements

- **Project Showcase**: Consider adding more details to project cards, possibly with modal dialogs.
- **Caching Strategy**: Implement cache headers or service worker for faster repeat visits.
- **Form Validation**: If adding a contact form, ensure robust validation.

### Accessibility Improvements

- **Focus States**: Add distinct focus states for keyboard navigation.
- **ARIA Attributes**: Add ARIA roles and labels for interactive components.
- **Alt Text**: Ensure all images have appropriate alt text.

## Conclusion

This portfolio site demonstrates strong front-end development skills with a clean, modern design and thoughtful architecture. The component-based approach and attention to visual details show a solid understanding of modern web development practices. With a few enhancements to accessibility and performance, this would be an excellent showcase of front-end expertise.
