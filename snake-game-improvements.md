# Portfolio Improvements

## Overview

This document details the improvements made to the tech portfolio website, including the Snake game Easter egg and the backend code editor display. These enhancements improve the user experience and fix various display and functionality issues.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Game Over on Startup

**Problem:**
The game was immediately triggering "Game Over" as soon as it was launched.

**Solution:**

- Initialize the snake with no initial movement (dx=0, dy=0)
- Only move the snake when a direction is set by the user
- Add instructional text to guide first-time players

```javascript
// Start with no movement
let dx = 0;
let dy = 0;

// Only move if a direction is set
if (dx !== 0 || dy !== 0) {
  // Movement code here
}

// Add instructions
ctx.fillStyle = "white";
ctx.font = "12px Arial";
ctx.textAlign = "center";
ctx.fillText(
  "Use arrow keys to start moving",
  canvas.width / 2,
  canvas.height / 2 + 30
);
```

### 2. Game Visibility Issues

**Problem:**
The game container wasn't properly displayed when activated.

**Solution:**

- Modified the CSS to correctly show/hide the game container
- Used `!important` flags to ensure style rules are properly applied
- Removed the default `display: none` which was causing conflicts

```css
#snake-game-container {
  /* Other styles... */

  &.snake-game {
    display: block !important;
  }
}

.snake-hidden {
  display: none !important;
}
```

### 3. Variable Scope Issues

**Problem:**
The `snakeGame` variable was defined in a different scope and not accessible across functions.

**Solution:**

- Made `snakeGame` a global property using `window.snakeGame`
- Updated all references to use the global variable
- Ensured proper state management when starting/ending the game

```javascript
// In main.js
window.snakeGame = false;

// When starting
window.snakeGame = true;

// When ending (in SnakeGame.js)
function closeGame() {
  window.snakeGame = false;
  // Other cleanup code
}
```

### 4. Page Refresh After Game Over

**Problem:**
Players needed to manually refresh the page between games.

**Solution:**

- Added automatic page refresh after the "Game Over" alert
- Used a short timeout to ensure proper cleanup before refreshing

```javascript
if (collision_detected) {
  clearInterval(gameLoop);
  alert("Game Over! Page will refresh for a new game.");
  closeGame();
  // Refresh the page after a short delay
  setTimeout(() => {
    window.location.reload();
  }, 500);
  return;
}
```

## Improved Game Controls

- Fixed the directional controls to prevent 180-degree turns
- Added proper event listener cleanup when closing the game
- Improved mobile controls with better touch targets

```javascript
// Keyboard control with improved direction handling
switch (e.key) {
  case "ArrowUp":
    if (dy !== 1) {
      dx = 0;
      dy = -1;
    }
    break;
  case "ArrowDown":
    if (dy !== -1) {
      dx = 0;
      dy = 1;
    }
    break;
  case "ArrowLeft":
    if (dx !== 1) {
      dx = -1;
      dy = 0;
    }
    break;
  case "ArrowRight":
    if (dx !== -1) {
      dx = 1;
      dy = 0;
    }
    break;
  case "Escape":
    document.removeEventListener("keydown", handleKeyDown);
    closeGame();
    break;
}
```

## Backend Code Editor Improvements

### 1. Height Adjustment for Better Visibility

**Problem:**
The code editor in the backend section wasn't displaying the full server.js content properly, cutting off the bottom portion.

**Solution:**

- Increased the height of both the code editor and API demo containers
- Made the editor content take up the full available height
- Used flexbox to properly structure the containers

```css
.code-editor {
  border-radius: 8px;
  overflow: hidden;
  box-shadow: 0 10px 30px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);
  background-color: #1e1e1e;
  height: 750px;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.editor-content {
  padding: 1rem;
  height: 100%;
  overflow-y: auto;
}
```

### 2. API Response Layout Optimization

**Problem:**
The API response section was too small due to the backend code editor height adjustments to properly display the response content.

**Solution:**

- Made the API demo container the same height as the code editor (750px)
- Created a flexible layout using flexbox for the endpoint list and response container
- Improved the overflow handling for scrollable content

```css
.api-demo {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  height: 750px;
}

.api-interaction {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  flex: 1;
  overflow: hidden;
}

.response-container {
  background-color: #1e1e1e;
  border-radius: 6px;
  padding: 1rem;
  overflow: auto;
  flex: 1;
}
```
